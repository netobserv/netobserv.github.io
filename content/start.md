# Getting Started

There are two independent starting points for using NetObserv:

- By [installing the operator](https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator/blob/main/README.md), allowing H24 network flows monitoring.
- By [using the CLI](https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-cli/blob/main/README.md), for on-demand monitoring and troubleshooting.
